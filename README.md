# M@TE: model template repository

## Q&A

What is the Model Atlas of the Earth

* M@TE is a curated archive of computational models of the Solid Earth.
* M@TE aims to fill a gap, into which such models often dissapear...
* Unlike other data repositories, M@TE cannot accept all models. Also unlike other archives, M@TE can accept very large datasets.
* We aim to provide a broad suite of models that can be used for teaching and egnagement as well as further reasearch.
* In some cases, M@TE will also accept "zombie" models where data has been lost. In these cases, the M@TE community can work collaboratively to attempt to resurrect these models. 

Why this submission process? 

* It's mainly about cellecting metadata to make align you model with FAIR principles (See Metadata Section in Resources.md)
* M@TE model data will be stored on a dedicted collection provided through NCIs GeoNetWork catalog.


## Model submission - quick start

Do you have an earth model/simulation to submit? 

1. Fork and Rename
   * See the __naming convention__ in RESOURCES.md
3. Fill in the `README.md` in the `model_description` , including steps like choosing a licence. 
4. Are you submitting data?
   * If yes, fill in the `README.md` in the `data_description`
   * If not, make a issue request for the model to be rerun by the community. Due to computatuional limitations,this may or may not be possible.  
5. Make a pull request. 

## What happens next? 

1. The M@TEs team will review the pull request, and if no changes are required accept into the Main branch
2. The model wil (automatically) trigger a post to be generated on out website (mates.science)
3. The model will be given a home on our NCI Server, and upload information will be provided to the creator
4. The model will be added to NCIs GeoNetwork Catalog, using the metadata informtion you provide.
